# What I used to learn how to code!!
There are a lot of resources online on how to develop applications, so I wanted to list out all the resources I used to get to where I am. I'm mainly a web developer by the way. I haven't explored apps outside of the browser yet though.  
P.S. I'm a CS student, so I've used my university's resources too, but most of the useful thing I've learned have been self-taught.

## Tools üî®
First, I had to download the tools and technologies I use on a daily basis. Right now, I use VSCode as a code editor, github to manage my git repositories, zsh as a terminal, and I occasionally use github desktop to run git commands. I also need node.js for daily development as I'm mainly a js developer. And lastly, I use Figma to prototype my designs.
1. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
3. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
4. [ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/)
5. [Figma](https://www.figma.com)   

** It's really useful to know how to use your terminal btw. You should understand basic commands like `cd` and `touch`. I picked them up overtime, but I recommend looking up a tutorial if you're a complete beginner.

## Tech Documentation üóí
I think reading documentation is the best way to learn how to use a tool. Personally, I use React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and a few more. I find the documentation for them and the tutorials they provide to be the best starting point, so here they are: 
1. [New React Docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/) (with hooks!!)
2. [Old React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) (with classes but still useful)
3. [Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/)
4. [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Web Development üíª
- I've only really followed one [full stack web development course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) from the University of Helsinki (not my university btw). It's a free, open online course, and I'm only 1/3 of the way through, but I've already learned so much. Like now I know more about react hooks, promises, how to make a json server, how to use axios, communicate with a backend rest api, use css, and more. The content and exercises are very high quality, and I really like it because you get to use VSCode as an editor and push your code to github. I find myself using the articles there as a reference too.
- I also bought this [react tutorial](https://react-tutorial.app/) earlier this year. I got through most of it and learned a lot of react basics, but it makes you write code in your browser, and it doesn't teach full stack web development.

## Favorite YouTube Channels üìç
To get started in web development, I watched a lot of youtube tutorials because I was really lost on where to start, so here are my favorite tech related youtube channels that I always trust to explain complicated js topics and frameworks (like async/await functions for example). For each, I linked a video of theirs I linked btw. I do figma design too, and I don't have any favorite channels for that. I recommend just looking up tutorials on how to design full apps.
1. [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8)
2. [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6P86uwfdR0)
3. [Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se72XMlG1Ro) (he's also a tiktok guy eek)
4. [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk&t=422s)
5. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw) (also I love Mike Dane)

## Java/Python Programming Problems (aka leetcode ?)
My university made us do a lot of coding problems in the intro to cs classes, and here are some resources I used to better understand oop and basic programming concepts. I don't really use Java or Python for web development or anything else though. However, I think it's still important to understand basic programming concepts.
1. [The University of Helsinki's Open Online Intro to Programming Course in Python](https://programming-21.mooc.fi/)
2. [The University of Helsinki's Java Programming Course](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)
3. [Python Crash Course Book](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition/dp/1593279280)
4. [Data Strucutres in Java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBpAmxU_NQo&t=1091s) (ew)

## Special Shoutout üéº
Shoutout to Spotify for helping me not be bored while coding. I have a whole [coding playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1BMekmhdQIQF6g8n47duPg?si=38441ac60eed4fbd) btw. Enjoy!
